Welcome to the world of text searching.
This is a simple file for demonstrating the grep utility.
Sometimes, you need to search for a word like "search".
The case can vary: SEARCH, Search, or even seArCh.
Remember to handle case-insensitive searches carefully.
Patterns like "utility" or "world" might also be of interest.
Don't forget to test for patterns that appear multiple times.
For example, the word "test" is used here as a test.
